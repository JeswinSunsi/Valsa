# Just a Personal Link Shortener

## What?
This is a website link shortener intended for personal use. It was created for the hack@home hackathon.

## Why?
I created this web app to get familiar with using Express and Node. I'm primarily a Python dev, but wanted to learn more about web technologies.

## How?
It uses Node's Express for all the processing work, the FS package for front end rendering and Mongoose for connecting into MongoDB. The site is hosted on Heroku.com.
